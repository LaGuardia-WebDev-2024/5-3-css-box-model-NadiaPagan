## Directions 
### Step #1 - Add spans <br>
This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish. In the first step, your job is to to make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out. Start by adding `<span>` tags around each first sentence. Then give both of your `<span>` tags a class called "first-sentence".
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Style Spans <br>
Good! Now, using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class. Make the sentence either italic (CSS Declaration - `font-style: italic;`), or underlined (CSS Declaration - `text-decoration: underline;`).
<br><br>
### Step #3 - Add a div <br>
Great! Wrap the paragraphs in a single `<div>`, and then give the div a class of "info".
<br><br>
### Step #4 - Style the Div <br>
Last step! Using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class. Give it a cool looking background color (CSS Property - `background-color: XXX;`).
